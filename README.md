# nvidia-kvm-patcher

Generic fix to NVIDIA Code 43 on Virtual Machines

### Quick Instructions

    1. Start NVIDIA Driver Setup, Exit Before Installing (Unpacks to C:/NVIDIA)
    2. Install the appropriate WDK/DDK (W10: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) , See OS Support
    3. If on Windows 7, See Windows 7 Workaround
    4. Enable Test Mode (In admin cmd: bcdedit /set testsigning on) and Reboot
    5. Open powershell and run patcher.ps1 C:\NVIDIA\DisplayDriver\372.54\Win10_64\International\Display.Driver
    6. Install Driver Through Extracted Installer (In C:/NVIDIA/DisplayDriver/Version)

### Details

So, the story so far:
You have a VM that uses a passed-through NVIDIA graphics card

However, the driver errored out with code 43, or outright blue-screened your VM

This is because NVIDIA "Introduced a Bug" making their driver "Fail" on "Unsupported configurations", such as having a geforce, by "accidentally" detecting the prescence of a hypervisor

### Alternate Workaround (recent libvirt + qemu)

            <kvm>
                <hidden state='on'/>
            </kvm>
            ...
            <hyperv>
                ...
                <vendor_id state='on' value='whatever'/>
            </hyperv>
            ...

```

### Troubleshooting

1. If testsigning fails, make sure you are running Windows 10 x64, and have the WDK Installed
2. Windows will attempt to overwrite the driver using versions from windows update, you will want to blacklists these updates using Microsoft's tool: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930
3. Having another problem? File an Issue. I would love some feedback on my crappy script.
4. Still getting error 43? Ensure the graphics card is using Message Signaled Interrupts before rebooting: http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=378044
5. Still getting error 43 even with MSIs? Some system configurations (hypervisor/hardware) may not be capable of supporting a passed through nvidia card. I have listed some systems that I have personally tested below.

### OS Support

* Windows 7 x64 is supported using the [Windows 7 DDK] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800)
* Windows 10 x64 is supported using the [Windows 10 WDK] (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit)

### Windows 7 Workaround

For some reason, at least on the test system, signtool in the Windows 7 WDK Pre-Dates The Timestamp (possible reverse timezone compensation???). To get around this, remove all instances of the SKSoftware Certificate using mmc (if you have ran the script before), pre-date your clock by 2 days, and execute gencert.ps1 using powershell.
